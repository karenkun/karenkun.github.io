## Note to self

2023/03/13

- Nav menu link order is determined by the .markdown page under metadata: "order".
- Might want to simply `layout` and `type` metadata because both have as its values: `page` and `post` ... it's a bit redundant.
- I've commented out Minima theme for now because it has ugly styles
- `"previewPath" :{{fm.categories}}/yyyy/MM/dd` doesn't work that affect posts with categories.
